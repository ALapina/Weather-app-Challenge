# Contributing

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting an issue, please use our Bug template for issue and fill out with details what was broken, best with screenshots and additional context.

## Making Changes

Changes are welcome via Github pull requests. If you are new to the project and looking for a way to get involved, try picking up an issue with a "good first issue" label. Hints about what needs to be done are usually provided.

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* We use convention that branch name for feature/bugfix are all lowercase and contains short summary, for example `add-contribution-guide` and `fix-readme-typo` are good branch names
* When creating commits, please follow [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines. We consider `feat: #1 Add contribution guide` a good starting point. See that we are including here type of changes (feat), issues number in GitHub (#1) adn a short summary of the changes. It is best if you can add additional context to the commit message - this helps to browse Git history a lot better experience. Types of commits that you can use to describe your changes:
    - **feat** - For feature changes
    - **fix** - For bugfixes
    - **docs** - For changes related to documentation
    - **chore** - For all other changes
* We expect that each feature/fix changes are also had new/updated documentation and new/updated tests
